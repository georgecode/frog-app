**NJ Frog Sounds** is a mobile web app that enables users to easily call and identify New Jersey frogs and toads.

## Our Mission

Identifying frog and toad species is a complicated process for conservation biologists. The scientists working in the field have few options and often lose contact with the amphibians before they are able to conclusively identify them. The goal of this project was to create an app that:

:frog: Allow conservationists to easily reference a frog and toad species unique call.
:frog:  Allow them to keep contact with the species by returning calls.
